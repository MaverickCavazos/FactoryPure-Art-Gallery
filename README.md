This is the Art Gallery Website Challenge for FactoryPure. This application was challenging and fun to design, it was made using pure HTML and CSS using the design specifications from a imported design on figma. It was also created with different screen sizes in mind creating specific versions for view widths of 1440px (desktop), 768px (tablet), and 375px (mobile).
